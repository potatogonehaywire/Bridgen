Got it 👍 You want this wireframe to feel more descriptive, user-friendly, and studious (like an educational/community platform) while still keeping the Pac-Man theme as a fun bridge between seniors and teens. I’ll rewrite it so it feels approachable, welcoming, and clear — something both generations can navigate with confidence.

Bridgen Website – Descriptive, User-Friendly Wireframe
